# Hyundai-Car-Price-Prediction
A price prediction model for Hyundai vehicles is a machine learning algorithm designed to predict the price of a Hyundai vehicle based on its features. The model is trained using a dataset of Hyundai vehicles that includes information about their features, such as engine size, horsepower, transmission, fuel efficiency, year of manufacture, mileage, etc., as well as their corresponding prices.

The model uses this dataset to learn the relationships between the different features and the price of a Hyundai vehicle. Once trained, the model can then take in new information about a Hyundai vehicle, such as its features, and use the learned relationships to predict its price.

The accuracy of the model can be evaluated by comparing the predicted prices to the actual prices of Hyundai vehicles in the test set. If the model performs well on the test set, it can be used to make predictions for new, unseen data.

Overall, a price prediction model for Hyundai vehicles can be a valuable tool for both buyers and sellers of Hyundai vehicles, as it can provide insight into the expected price of a vehicle based on its features.
